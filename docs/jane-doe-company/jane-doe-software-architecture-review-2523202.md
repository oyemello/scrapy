## Overview

This review covers the financial transaction system that supports reporting, reconciliation, and compliance with quarterly audits. The focus is on scalability, security, and integration with external banking APIs.

## Architecture issues



| **Architecture issue** | **Business impact** | **Priority** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Slow report generation under load | Delays quarter-end financial close, impacts regulatory deadlines | HIGH | Current queries not optimized for large datasets |
| API throttling with external banks | Failed transaction sync, customer dissatisfaction | HIGH | Need retry/queuing mechanism |
| Legacy authentication system | Security vulnerabilities, audit compliance risks | MEDIUM | Migrate to OAuth 2.0 |
| Inconsistent error logging | Hard to trace reconciliation errors, slows audits | LOW | Standardize logging format |

## Stakeholders



| **Name** | **Role** |

| Sarah Kim | Finance Systems Architect |
| John Rivera | CTO |
| Priya Mehta | Backend Engineer |
| Emily Carter | Compliance & Risk Officer |
| CFOâ€™s Office | Business stakeholder |

## Software quality attributes



|  | **Definition** | **Key success metrics** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Availability** | System uptime for financial services | 99.95% uptime, < 2 hours downtime per quarter | Must meet SOX compliance |
| Security | Protection of sensitive financial data | No critical vulnerabilities, passed audits | Use encryption at rest + in transit |
| Scalability | Ability to handle peak loads (quarter-end) | Handle 5x normal traffic without degradation | Stress test before Q4 close |
| Performance | Transaction & report latency | < 2s for transactions, < 5s for reports | Optimize queries + caching |
| Auditability | Ability to track & verify transactions | 100% traceability, standardized logs | Key for compliance audits |

## Goals

* Improve performance of quarterly financial reports by 40%
* Enhance security posture with modern authentication and encryption
* Increase system scalability to handle 5x traffic during peak reporting cycles
* Standardize error logging and monitoring for audit readiness
